/ Gives you control of your own virtual resources
/ Logically isolated from other VPCs
/ When you create a VPC you must give it a CIDR block. The largest is /16 and the smallest is /28
 * CIDR (a range of small IP addresses)
 
 / Elastic Network Interface
 * You cannot detach a primary elastic network interface
 
 /Route tables - each subnet must be associated with a route table. The mapping is 1:1
 /An Internet gateway (IGW) is a VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the Internet.
 /After creating a VPC, you can add subnets. Each subnet resides entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. 
  If a subnet's traffic is routed to an Internet Gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet. 
  If a subnet does not have a route to the Internet gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet.
  
  / NAT - The wizard will also create a NAT Gateway, which is used to provide internet connectivity to EC2 instances in the private subnets.
