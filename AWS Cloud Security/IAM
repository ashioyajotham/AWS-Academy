# IAM - a web service that enables Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to manage users and user permissions in AWS. 
        With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.
 
 When creating an AWS Identity and Access Management(IAM) policy, there are two types of access:
    * Programmatic access
    * AWS Management Console access
