 ******************* SHared Responsibility model ********************************
 /In the shared responsibility, AWS is responsible for providing security of the cloud while customer is responsible for security in the cloud
 
 /The customer is responsible for the encryption of data at rest and data in transit. 
  The customer should also ensure that the network is configured for security and that security credentials and logins are managed safely. 
  Additionally, the customer is responsible for the configuration of security groups and the 
   configuration of the operating system that run on compute instances that they launch (including updates and security patches). 
   
 /Under the AWS shared responsibility model, AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the bare metal host operating system and 
   hypervisor virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where the services operate. 
   It means that AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. 
   The global infrastructure includes AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations
