// Distributes incoming network or application traffic across various targets
* Targets - are the individual instances that will respond to requests from the Load Balancer.
* Target Groups define where to send traffic that comes into the Load Balancer. 
  The Application Load Balancer can send traffic to multiple Target Groups based upon the URL of the incoming request, such as having requests from mobile apps going to a different set of servers. 
  Your web application will use only one Target Group.
// Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. 
  It enables you to achieve fault tolerance in your 
  applications by seamlessly providing the required amount of load balancing capacity needed to route application traffic.
// Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity out or 
   in automatically according to conditions you define. You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances. 
   Auto Scaling can also automatically increase the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs. 
   Auto Scaling is well suited to applications that have stable demand patterns or that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage.

Types
   + Application Load Balancer
     -  operates at the request level (layer 7), routing traffic to targets — EC2 instances, containers, 
        IP addresses and Lambda functions — based on the content of the request.
   + Network Load Balancer - TCP, UDP and TLS traffic
   + Classic Load Balancer (older gen.)

* A load balancer can be configured for health checks
