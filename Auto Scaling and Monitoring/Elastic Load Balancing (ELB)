// Distributes incoming network or application traffic across various targets
// Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. 
  It enables you to achieve fault tolerance in your 
  applications by seamlessly providing the required amount of load balancing capacity needed to route application traffic.
// Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity out or 
   in automatically according to conditions you define. You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances. 
   Auto Scaling can also automatically increase the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs. 
   Auto Scaling is well suited to applications that have stable demand patterns or that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage.
